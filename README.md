# Welcome to your Leaderboard app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Overview

This Leaderboard project is a mobile application built using React Native and Expo that displays a ranked list of users based on the number of bananas they have. Users can search for a specific username to see their ranking and compare it with others. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, offering various sorting and searching options to enhance user experience.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
